The project, Human Stress Level Detection Using Machine Learning, aims to identify stress
levels based on physiological data. With the increasing prevalence of stress-related health issues,
early detection and monitoring have become crucial for preventing more severe conditions. This
project leverages machine learning to predict stress levels using readily available physical metrics
such as age, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, heart rate, weight, and height. By analyzing these
indicators, the model outputs a stress level on a scale from 1 to 5, where each level represents a
progressive increase in stress severity. This allows for a scalable solution to support both healthcare
providers and individuals in monitoring stress, promoting mental and physical well-being through
timely intervention.
To achieve accurate predictions, we utilized a logistic regression model. Logistic regression, known
for its interpretability and efficiency, is suitable for classifying categorical outputs, which aligns well
with our goal of categorizing stress into five distinct levels. The model processes the inputs by
assessing the correlation between physiological metrics and stress responses, establishing a
relationship that enables precise stress level detection. Through model training on a structured
dataset, the logistic regression algorithm learns to classify subtle changes in vital signs and
demographic information that may indicate stress. The simplicity of logistic regression also makes it
feasible to deploy in real- time systems, which can benefit healthcare settings that require quick
assessments.
In application, our system can be a valuable tool in both clinical and non-clinical environments,
offering users insights into their stress levels based on personal health data.For healthcare providers,
this tool can assist in identifying patients who might benefit from stress management techniques,
thereby integrating preventive healthcare into routine check-ups. For individuals, this project
provides an accessible means to self-monitor stress, fostering awareness of personal health and
promoting lifestyle adjustments. Overall, this project underscores the potential of machine learning
in enhancing stress management strategies by providing accurate, data-driven stress assessments
