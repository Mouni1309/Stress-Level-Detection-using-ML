# Human Stress Level Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to identify human stress levels based on physiological data. With the increasing prevalence of stress-related health issues, early detection and continuous monitoring have become crucial for preventing more severe conditions. This project leverages machine learning to predict stress levels using readily available physical metrics such as age, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, heart rate, weight, and height. By analyzing these indicators, the model outputs a stress level on a scale from 1 to 5, where each level represents a progressive increase in stress severity. This approach provides a scalable solution to support healthcare providers and individuals in monitoring stress, promoting mental and physical well-being through timely intervention.

To achieve accurate predictions, we utilized a logistic regression model. Logistic regression, known for its interpretability and efficiency, is well-suited for classifying categorical outputs, which aligns with our goal of categorizing stress into five distinct levels. The model processes inputs by assessing correlations between physiological metrics and stress responses, establishing relationships that enable precise stress level detection. Through training on a structured dataset, the logistic regression algorithm learns to classify subtle changes in vital signs and demographic information that may indicate stress. The simplicity of logistic regression also makes it feasible to deploy in real-time systems, which can benefit healthcare settings that require quick assessments.

In practice, our system can be a valuable tool in both clinical and non-clinical environments, offering users insights into their stress levels based on personal health data. For healthcare providers, this tool can assist in identifying patients who might benefit from stress management techniques, integrating preventive healthcare into routine check-ups. For individuals, this project provides an accessible means to self-monitor stress, fostering awareness of personal health and encouraging lifestyle adjustments. Overall, this project underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing stress management strategies by providing accurate, data-driven stress assessments.
